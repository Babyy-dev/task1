## 🧐 Development Approach & Trade-offs

**Approach**

The project was built using a modern component-based architecture with React and TypeScript, leveraging Vite for a fast development experience. Material-UI (MUI) was chosen for its comprehensive, pre-built components and customizable theme, which helped to quickly establish a consistent and professional design. The UI for the pricing cards was developed as a reusable BillingCard component.

**Trade-offs**

A key trade-off was balancing layout flexibility with visual consistency for the pricing cards. Initially, a "most popular" card used a scaling transform, which created size discrepancies. To ensure all cards were uniform in size and appearance, the scaling effect and conditional styling were removed.
